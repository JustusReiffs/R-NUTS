## Introduction

```{r}
diamonds
```

## Variation

### Visualising distributions

Bar charts can be used to visualise the distribution of a categorical variable.

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut))
```

The distribution of a continuous variable is typically visualised using a histogram.

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = carat), binwidth = 0.5)
```

You can set the width of the intervals in a histogram with the `binwidth` argument.

```{r}
smaller <- diamonds %>% 
  filter(carat < 3)
  
ggplot(data = smaller, mapping = aes(x = carat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1)
```

Suppose we would like to overlay multiple histograms (e.g. for different cuts), it is recommended to use `geom_freqpoly`, which uses lines instead of bars to display the distribution.

```{r}
ggplot(data = smaller, mapping = aes(x = carat, colour = cut)) +
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.1)
```

### Typical values

Essentially, in both bar charts and histograms, tall bars show the common values of a variable, and shorter bars show less-common values.

```{r}
ggplot(data = smaller, mapping = aes(x = carat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01)
```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/OldFaithful1948.jpg')
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = faithful, mapping = aes(x = eruptions)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.25)
```

### Unusual values

Do you see the unusual wide x axis? Typically, this is because of outliers! 

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) + 
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = y), binwidth = 0.5)
```

Let's zoom in by changing the limits of the y axis.

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) + 
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = y), binwidth = 0.5) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 20))
```

Next, based on the previous plot we can learn more about these exceptional cases.

```{r}
unusual <- diamonds %>% 
  filter(y < 3 | y > 20) %>% 
  select(price, x, y, z) %>%
  arrange(y)

unusual
```

### Missing values

Removing outliers is simple.

```{r}
diamonds2 <- diamonds %>% 
  filter(between(y, 3, 20))
```

But perhaps other measurements of these diamonds were okay, so probably it is better to replace unusual values with missing values.

```{r}
diamonds2 <- diamonds %>% 
  mutate(y = ifelse(y < 3 | y > 20, NA, y))
```

### Covariation

#### Categorical and continuous variable

Let’s explore how the price of a diamond varies with the quality of the cut.

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = price)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(mapping = aes(colour = cut), binwidth = 500)
```

It’s hard to see the difference in distribution because the overall counts differ so much.

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut))
```

Therefore, we could also plot the _density_, which is the count standardised so that the area under each frequency polygon is one.

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = price, y = ..density..)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(mapping = aes(colour = cut), binwidth = 500)
```

Let’s take a look at the distribution of price by cut using `geom_boxplot()`:

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, y = price)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Boxplot_vs_PDF.svg')
```

Another example.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

To make the trend easier to see, we can reorder class based on the median value of `hwy`.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = reorder(class, hwy, FUN = median), y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip()
```

#### Two categorical variables

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_count(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = color))
```

Alternatively, you can manually create a count variable and then use `geom_tile()`.

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  count(color, cut) %>%  
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = color, y = cut)) +
    geom_tile(mapping = aes(fill = n))
```

#### Two continuous variables

Scatterplots help understanding the covariation between two continous variables.

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price), alpha = 1/100)
```

Another solution is to use bin. Previously you used `geom_histogram()` and `geom_freqpoly()` to bin in one dimension. Now we'll use `geom_bin2d()` and `geom_hex()` to bin in two dimensions.

```{r}
ggplot(data = smaller) +
  geom_bin2d(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price))

ggplot(data = smaller) +
  geom_hex(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price))
```

Another option is to bin one continuous variable so it acts like a categorical variable. Then you can use one of the techniques for visualising the combination of a categorical and a continuous variable that you learned about. For example, you could bin carat and then for each group, display a boxplot.

```{r}
ggplot(data = smaller, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) + 
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(group = cut_width(carat, 0.1)))
```

Another approach is to display approximately the same number of points in each bin.

```{r}
ggplot(data = smaller, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) + 
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(group = cut_number(carat, 20)))
```
